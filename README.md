emane-node-director
==

emane-node-director is a command line application for manipulating NEM
position, orientation, velocity (POV) and antenna selection and
pointing at runtime. Node states can be snapshot in a stop motion
workflow to create mobility scenarios in EEL file
format. emane-node-director requires an EEL file as input to set
initial node POVs. If the EEL file has multiple time steps, NEMs
can be manually stepped forward and backward to each scenario state.
